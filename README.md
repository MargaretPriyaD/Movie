Movie App is a Kotlin-based Android application developed using Jetpack Compose, designed to provide users with an engaging and intuitive movie browsing experience. The app features a visually appealing interface that presents a curated list of hardcoded movies. Users can search for specific titles, filter movies by genre, view detailed movie information (including ratings and overviews), explore the cast associated with each film, and manage a personalized watchlist.
This project leverages the modern declarative UI approach offered by Jetpack Compose, which simplifies UI development and promotes reusable, modular components. The app architecture ensures smooth navigation between screens, reactive state management, and a user-friendly interface, making it both a learning tool and a practical mobile solution for movie enthusiasts.
